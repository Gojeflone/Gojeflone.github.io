                            Normally, the work of a developer stops at the engineering of the site. That could not be farther from the reality of this project.
                            Due to the requirements of the project and the knowledgability of the client, I managed the entire site launch myself. Not to toot my own horn
                            but it was definitely a great and rewarding experience. The client runs a small business offering landscaping and horticulture services to the areas nearby. 
                            In the off season, the client was looking for ways to ensure consistent work without having to rely on canvassing the local area. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Given the time period for this project, COVID ended up hitting us in the middle of site development. Having such a major event occur during the development
                            process added another level of complexity that would have otherwise not have been preferred. Needless to say, we were able to launch successfully and establish a great 
                            and long term relationship with the client. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Working on this project gave me experience with Project Management, Front End and Backend development, as well experience with working with the Squarespace environment. 
                            In my youth, I spent some time making some Wix sites when flash was all the rage. Due to the business requirements of the client and my curiosity for this "Wix"-eque CMS,
                            I lept at the opportunity. To my surprise, it was nothing like Wix. The process felt more intuitive from a Developer's point of view, and developing custom sections and code 
                            was incredibly easy. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Finally, under Kismet Creative, I assist the client in a marketing capacity, creating marketing materials, collecting mailing lists, running campaigns, etc. It has been an 
                            interesting journey to say the least, but our methodology at Kismet made execution of this facet of the client's needs very easy to fulfill.
