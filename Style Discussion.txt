About the Style

So, what kinda theme/style are we going for here? Let's not be afraid to 
think out of the box.
Like what kinda vibe, feel do you want the website to have?

Let's get some ideas going on color schemes, designs for whatever we
can think of and we can create specific CSS styles for those things
or we can use our basic concepts to start creating larger theme concepts.

We just gotta keep the goal of the site in mind, and make sure the theme is effective
to not only getting to that goal, but looking fly as hell in the process.
