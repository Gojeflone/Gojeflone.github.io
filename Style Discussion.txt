About the Style

So, what kinda theme/style are we going for here? Let's not be afraid to 
think out of the box.
Like what kinda vibe, feel do you want the website to have?
	I want the website to feel very similar to the design of the 
	game. Let's model the website after the feel of the game

	Like I know you mentioned at one point, there is that feeling 
	of a bar game within Gwent so let's keep that in mind.

	Let's make a cow with a crown on it's head or something the 
	mascot

Let's get some ideas going on color schemes, designs for whatever we
can think of and we can create specific CSS styles for those things
or we can use our basic concepts to start creating larger theme concepts.

We just gotta keep the goal of the site in mind, and make sure the theme is effective
to not only getting to that goal, but looking fly as hell in the process.
