    <h1>PRIZE WINNING COW</h1>
    <p>For all your Gwent needs, motherfuckers.</p>

    <h2>What We Need To Do</h2> 
    <p>Create a CSS style(? Not even sure if Im phrasing this right) Just a design for the site</p>
    <p>Decide which tools are essential to the site (Deckbuilders, guides, yadda yadda)</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" >W3Schools HTML Guide I've been referencing for HTML stuff</a>
     
    <a href=" http://getbootstrap.com/" > Possible implementing </a>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p> WORK IN PROGRESS </p>
      <p>We consider Gwent, created by CD Projekt RED, to be an extraordinary game. First, CD Project RED shared with us 
      Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher and gave us the opportunity to explore this magical world firsthand. Now, they have given us
      what we spent so many hours doing in Witcher 3: Playing the game within the game. </p>

    <p>
      Our goal at PrizeWinning Cow is to further permit you to immerse yourself in this world, both in card knowledge and in lore.
      So that we may share with each other what we so thoroughly enjoy. Sit down, kick your feet up, and play your best deck. 
      Because we sure will.
      </p>
